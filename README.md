**Author: Chenxi Ge, David Kes, Chuan Xu, Zhengjie Xu**

#### Background

The goal of this project is to forecast Canadian monthly bankruptcy rates for the year 2011 and 2012 using a time series model.

#### Data
The primary data for constructing the model is the historic Canadian monthly bankruptcy rates from January 1987 to December 2010. Other data used are: unemployment rate, population size, and housing price index (HPI).

The plot above provides us insights on trend and seasonality of the data. Specifically, the bankruptcy rate shows increasing trend in the long term and seasonal fluctuations. Also note that the house price index is closely correlated to bankruptcy rate.
